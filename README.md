Problem Statement
Up to this point, all of the HTML elements we've seen are used to display data to users. This is great, but what happens when we want to get information from our users? In order to get user information we need to write HTML forms. We will learn to write them in this lesson.

Objectives
State the purpose of a form
Write an HTML form tag
Define the GET vs POST HTTP methods
Write HTML form data elements
State The Purpose Of a Form
Forms gather user information. They're just like surveys you might fill out at a supermarket or a questionnaire you'd fill out at the doctor's office.

Let's suppose that you're the owner of a dog walking business that needs a way to gather information from clients. You would use an HTML form to collect information like:

owner's name
owner's address
dog's name
dog's age
walking frequency
You collect this information in HTML tags called inputs located within the form tag. You will also code a "Submit" button so the client can say "OK! I'm done!" We'll discuss inputs in more detail below.

When the owner fills out the form's inputs and clicks "Submit," a record of their responses will be sent to a server where the information can be stored. Once the server has the information stored, software can be written to use the server's information to create newsletters, login accounts, or invitations to client-appreciation parties.

To store the information, we need a language like Ruby, PHP, or Java. We won't be covering storage and usage in this lesson. Writing code to handle things like that is "back-end engineering." Luckily, all those languages are designed to receive the information sent by an HTML form.

Let's write an HTML form. We'll use the form tag.

Write An HTML Form Tag
The starting element in an HTML form is the <form> tag. The form element wraps all the input elements that will collect our users' information inside of them. We will cover input elements in great detail after finishing discussing the attributes within a form tag.

The form tag's first attribute, action, decides where the user information is sent. This is typically the URL of a server. This server will run the Ruby, PHP, or Java (or other!) code required to store the information the form sends.

The second attribute, method, sets the HTTP method the browser will use to send the user information to the server. You can think of "HTTP method" as being like an envelope type. Some envelopes are good for documents, others are good for confidential letters, and yet others are good for overseas mail. The HTTP methods used in forms are GET and POST.

While you won't write the "back-end" code here, we'll describe what you see as a user when an HTML author chooses GET versus POST.

Define The GET vs. POST HTTP Methods
GET
Below we see the form example code for making a GET request.


  
  
  
  

When the user clicks the submit button, their responses in the input fields are captured and labeled using the name attributes from each element. The browser stores this information behind the scenes like this:

owner-name=Bob+Barkley&dog-name=SirBarksALot&favorite-toy=ball

This is known as the Query String. The browser then attaches the Query String onto the location listed in the form's action attribute after a ? to create a URL that looks like this:

http://example.com/process-user.php?owner-name=Bob+Barkley&dog-name=SirBarksALot&favorite-toy=ball

The browser then goes to this new URL. The server then uses back-end programming to use the information in the Query String to change what it will show.

When a Query String is added to a URL, it's a great solution for filtering the information that comes back. Forms are a nice way for users to add those filters without typing them in by hand. You've probably seen this on the internet.

Amazon Using a Form with GET

Here, Amazon uses a form tag with method of GET to filter their huge store. They filter based on matches of the <input type="text" name="field-keywords">. We typed in "dog toys" into that text field input.

While this is a great method for things like search, this is bad for passwords, obviously! A Query String with password=ByronBestPoodle will stand out! When you need to send your response in a way that doesn't leak information, you want your form to use the POST HTTP method.

ADVANCED: An advanced concept is that a GET request is "idempotent." That means the browser can run it repeatedly without changing information on the back-end. We can ask for a filtered list of dog toys again and again and again by hitting Refresh again and again and again. Nothing changes on the server if we do that.

POST
Below we see the same form example code for making a POST request.


  
  
  
  

It's the same form you would write for a GET-method form, but with the method attribute changed.

When the user clicks the submit button, their responses in the input fields are captured and labeled using the name attributes from each element. The browser stores this information like this:

owner-name=Bob+Barkley&dog-name=SirBarksALot&favorite-toy=ball

A POST is like a secure envelope. We can't see the information being sent. That's why POST is the right call when sending sensitive information like passwords or national IDs. The user's browser is not redirected in this case. We can't show you a screenshot of what this looks like because, well, there's nothing to show. Usually after a successful POST, the web site will send you to a page that says "Thanks for your purchase" or "Thanks for joining our site."

ADVANCED: An advanced concept is that a POST request is not "idempotent." If the browser runs it repeatedly, it will change data on the back end. Submitting payment for a credit card is not idempotent. Each refresh will take money out of your bank account! That's why many finance sites say "Don't refresh this page while we process your request."

Now that we know how to write a form tag and we understand the HTTP action that goes in its action attribute, let's talk about different ways we can ask for information within our form by choosing the right input.

Write HTML Form Data Elements
What is an input?

Think about a doctor's questionnaire: sometimes they ask you to fill-in-the-blank, sometimes they ask you to mark checkboxes next to symptoms, and other times they ask you to write a short answer. They ask all these different types of questions within the same questionnaire or form. All of those types of questionnaire prompts have a cousin in an HTML input. A fill-in-the-blank is an <input type="text">. A short essay's twin is <input type="textarea">.

The rest of this lesson will be spent introducing you to the input elements.

Text Field Input
Creating an input tag with type="text" gives our users a place to type in a single line of text. It looks like this:

<input type="text" name="owner-name" placeholder="Full Name">

The placeholder attribute puts some dummy text into the element. That text will be replaced when the user starts filling it in. The name attribute gives our input a name.

Here's a screenshot:

Generally, HTML form attributes should not contain spaces. Common exceptions to this rule are placeholder and class. If you're not sure whether or not your attribute can contain a space, check out this article (Links to an external site.).

A Note on Labels
You might have noticed we sneaked an extra tag in, the label tag. When writing forms, we don't want to describe what goes in the form by using p tags. We can more meaningfully "tie" descriptive text (that is, a label) to an input field using the label tag. The id attribute of the input is provided to the label's for attribute and the browser knows to put them close to each other.

Labels are not strictly necessary on HTML forms. But they make our site better for those using assistive devices. It's the Right Thing to Do.

Why do we put both labels and placeholders? First, not all browsers and assistive devices support placeholder attributes. Labels help assistive devices help users who need them more easily enter data. Again, it's part of our desire to create an inclusive and accessible web.

Password Inputs
Creating an input tag with type="password" gives our users a place to type information that will not be displayed by the browser. Most of the time browsers put * or dots instead of the character. This is useful when private information is entered, so your password isn't displayed for others to see.

What's the password?

Here's a screenshot:

Telephone Inputs
Creating an input tag with type="tel" behaves like a text field, but will bring up the numeric keypad on supported mobile devices.

Where should E.T. â„¢ Phone Home?

Here's a screenshot:

Submit Inputs
Creating an input tag with type="submit" creates a submit button that, when clicked, will do something with a user's form data. The value attribute holds the text that will appear on the button.


Here's a screenshot:

Radio Inputs
Radio inputs show users many options. But radio buttons allow users to select only one. You will set different value attributes for each radio button, but they must have the same name attribute.

Does your dog get along with other dogs?


 The more dogs, the better!

 It depends on the dog, but generally they are ok

 My dog prefers their walkies solo

Checkboxes
Checkboxes are like radio buttons...but you can choose more than one.

What are your dogs favorite toys?


 Kong 

Stuffed Animals

Rope Toys

Squeaky Toys

Balls, Frisbees, anything a dog can fetch!

Here's a screenshot:

Select Menus
This is pretty advanced!

Select menus create a drop-down menu. Inside the select tag you use option tags to create a menu. Inside the option tag you say what will be shown in the menu. In the value option you say what will be sent as part of the Query String. For the example below the Query String would contain size="small".

What size is your dog?



  Small(0-25 pounds)
  Medium (26-50 pounds)
  Large (51-75 pounds)
  Extra Large (over 75 pounds)

Here's a screenshot:

Textarea
Textarea elements are useful if we want our users to be able to be able to write multiple lines of text. For example, if we wish to allow our clients to write special notes for their dogs, we can let them write as much or as little as they like.

Any other things we should know about your dog?

Summary
We use HTML forms to collect data from users. Start with a form element. Give it an action and method, probably POST. Inside the form add several input elements. Use the best input for the data you're requesting. Make sure that your inputs are clearly labeled. If you follow these guidelines you'll soon be getting all the user data you can handle!
